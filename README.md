# Lead-Scoring-Case-Study
Lead Scoring Case Study

## Goal:
1. Build a logistic regression model to assign a lead score between 0 and 100 to each of the leads which can be used by the company to target potential leads. A higher score would mean that the lead is hot, i.e. is most likely to convert whereas a lower score would mean that the lead is cold and will mostly not get converted.
2. There are some more problems presented by the company which your model should be able to adjust to if the company's requirement changes in the future so you will need to handle these as well. These problems are provided in a separate doc file. Please fill it based on the logistic regression model you got in the first step. Also, make sure you include this in your final PPT where you'll make recommendations.


## Following steps are performed:

- Outlier Analysis
- Visualising Data (EDA)
- Creating dummy variables
- Splitting the Data into Training and Testing Sets
- Feature Scaling
- Correlations Analysis
- Feature Selection
- Model Building-Assessing the model with StatsModels
- Creating Predictions
- Model Evaluation
- Finding Optimal Cutoff Threshold point
- Making predictions on the test set
